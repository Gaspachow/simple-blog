## Project Goal
Create a dynamic NextJS image/blog website.  
Warning: This site is ugly for now, as the current priority is to test and link all back-end using NextJS

## Stack
- NextJS Framework (duh...)
- MongoDB (using Mongoose) to store all posts data including image *URL*
- Cloudinary widget to host the images and use its various transformation tools
- React-Bootstrap

## Current WIP 
- Need to implement frontpage dynamically pulling every post from MongoDB and displaying them.
- Good looking, responsive front-page
- TBD: Layout component  

##     
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
